I bought a 1.5Tbyte My Book Essential external USB drive from Western
Digital. The box does not say what drive is inside and the USB
interface does not reveal it either. Creating the ext3 file system
took surprisingly long. I remember reading about the performance hit
of the new WD Caviar drives, but I didn't expect to be affected by
this because I thought the USB interface would be the bottleneck
anyway, which is an incorrect assumption.

Hard disk drive manufacturers are in transition from 512 bytes per
sector to 4096 bytes per sector. The larger sector size is referred to
as [Advanced Format][2] or [Bigsector][3]. Big words to create
awareness for the transition.

I tried aligning the partition as described in [this][4] excellent
article. I did some tests, with and without alignment. The results are
below.

Difference for large files:
---------------------------

### Without alignment: ###

    epronk@godiva:~$ time cp largefilemedia/disk/

    real  10m44.546s
    user    0m0.332s
    sys    0m32.430s

### With alignment: ###

    epronk@godiva:~$ time cp largefile /media/disk/

    real   8m49.902s
    user    0m0.412s
    sys    0m36.746s

Difference for raw writes:
--------------------------

These are raw write operations on an empty disk, but with taking the
file system (ext3) into consideration. The difference with copying a
large file is there is no reading of a source file part of the
operation.

### Without alignment: ###

    epronk@godiva:~$ time dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/disk/test bs=1024 count=$[1024*1024]
    
	1048576+0 records in
	1048576+0 records out
	1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 39.225 s, 27.4 MB/s
	
### With alignment: ###
	
    epronk@godiva:~$ time dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/disk/test bs=1024 count=$[1024*1024]

	1048576+0 records in
	1048576+0 records out
	1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 32.5642 s, 33.0 MB/s

3.4Gbyte of small/medium sized files:
------------------------------------

This is a collection of small files (source files / object files /
libraries etc.) which I think is more typical usage of the disk.

### Without alignment: ###

    epronk@godiva:~$ time cp -a src /media/disk/
	
    real   48m16.739s
    user     0m2.996s
    sys     0m48.459s

### With alignment: ###

    epronk@godiva:~$ time cp -a src /media/disk

    real    7m59.009s
    user     0m3.300s
    sys     0m54.071s

The partition table:
--------------------

This is what my partition table for the drive looks like. The
important part is the first partition needs to start at sector 64 (this has
to be a multiple of 4098/512 = 8) instead of sector 63 which is the default.

    Expert command (m for help): p

    Disk /dev/sdb: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 182315 cylinders

    Nr AF  Hd Sec  Cyl  Hd Sec  Cyl     Start      Size ID
     1 00   1   1    0 254  63 1023         64 2928890411 83
     2 00   0   0    0   0   0    0          0          0 00
     3 00   0   0    0   0   0    0          0          0 00
     4 00   0   0    0   0   0    0          0          0 00

Conclusion:
-----------

If you decide to re-partition and format the drive you need to be aware of this. The difference for raw writes or large files is significant, but for copying a large set of files the difference is huge. A *factor 6* faster was a surprising result.
