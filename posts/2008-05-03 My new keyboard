<p>This week I received my ergonomic  <a href="http://www.maltron.com/">Maltron</a> keyboard. I bought it as a preventative measure for RSI. If your hands or wrists are giving you warning signals, consider one of these. I&#8217;m currently doing the online training course and hope to switch over within a week.</p>
